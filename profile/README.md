## About Ice

Ice is a comprehensive RPC framework that helps you build distributed applications with minimal effort. Ice allows you
to focus your efforts on your application logic, and it takes care of all interactions with low-level network
programming interfaces. With Ice, there is no need to worry about details such as opening network connections,
serializing and deserializing data for network transmission, or retrying failed connection attempts.
