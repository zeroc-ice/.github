## About ICE

The Internet Communications Engine (Ice) is an object-oriented RPC framework that helps you build distributed
applications with minimal effort. Ice allows you to focus your efforts on your application logic, and it takes care of
all interactions with low-level network programming interfaces. With Ice, there is no need to worry about details such
as opening network connections, serializing and deserializing data for network transmission, or retrying failed
connection attempts.
